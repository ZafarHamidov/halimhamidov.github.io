My learning goals are on way according to Dalio's principles
Hello World!
Я проплыл бассейн.
42 piscine pool during June 03-28 of 2019 year.
I got 8th place among "Slizni" and 12-14 place among 198 out of 336 students.
There are overall 777 working stations at school.
I failed exam02 & final exam with grades 11 & 13 resp.
Because it was my first time coding in C.
& I quite didn't quite understand the basics of pointers, multidimensional arrays, so on.
And I have to review the courses of EDX program and the C piscine exam exercises and solutions beforehand I pass the piscine.
